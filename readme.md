# How it works

Log in using random identifiers.
Email must be at mail format.
Password must be at least 8 characters, have minimum 1 letter, 1 number and 1 special symbol.
Checkbox must be checked.

If everything is correct, login button should be enabled, press it to get redirected.

Click Go to Map button to see google map.
(City name input is here for testing purposes, but feature doesn't work yet)
Note that there may be some crashes when opening the map, uninstall and rebuild the app should make it work again.
